This example demos the use of higher level APIs exposed by this library for simpler and faster coding to use MQTT pubsub features with SSL verification.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Publish to a predefined topic in predefined intervals.(10 seconds by default)
\item Subscribe to a predefined topic.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{quote}
To verify both the above features with one device, use the same topic for publish and subscribe. \end{quote}
