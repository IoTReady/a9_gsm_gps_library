This code gives you a choice between three different modes of SPI communication. You can make this choice by uncommenting the desired mode from \href{./a9_spi_lib/src/spi_example.c\#L13-L15}{\texttt{ these}} three macros. It is however important to note that only one of those three modes can be selected at once.

If you want to adapt this example to other use-\/cases, check \href{./a9_spi_lib/include/spi_lib.h}{\texttt{ spi\+\_\+lib.\+h}} for comments with some implementation details against the functions available.\hypertarget{md_a9_spi_lib__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md11}{}\doxysection{Running the SPI example\+:}\label{md_a9_spi_lib__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md11}
